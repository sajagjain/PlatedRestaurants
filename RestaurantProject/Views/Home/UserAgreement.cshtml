        Part I - Reservation Services

        1.  Restaurant Reservations. Plated makes available restaurant reservation services (the “Reservation Services”) and waitlist services (the “Waitlist Services”) through the Plated Sites to User for the purpose of assisting User in securing dining reservations or joining a waitlist at participating third-party restaurants (each, a “Restaurant”). In response to a User’s online request for a Restaurant reservation or to join a waitlist through the OpenTable Sites, OpenTable contacts the Restaurant’s computerized database of reservations and waitlists, as applicable. The availability of reservations, estimated wait time or place in line on a waitlist is determined at the time of User’s query and based on information provided to OpenTable by the Restaurant. Once a reservation or waitlist request is made by User through the OpenTable Sites, OpenTable will provide confirmation of the reservation or waitlist status to User by email or other electronic messages as has been agreed to by User. By using the Reservation Services or Waitlist Services, User agrees to receive reservation and waitlist confirmations, updates, modifications and/or cancellations by email or other electronic messages.

        2.  No-Show Policy. Plated is committed to providing superior quality services to Users and Restaurants. To assist us in maintaining a consistently high level of service for the Restaurants and their patrons, Users must cancel any reservations that they will be unable to honor at least 30 minutes in advance of the reservation. You may cancel your reservation via the Plated Sites or by calling the Restaurant directly. Some Restaurants may require a debit or credit card number to finalize your reservation.  In order to use the Reservation Services for these Restaurants, you must provide valid debit or credit card information. To confirm that the debit or credit card information you have provided is accurate, we may place a temporary authorization on your debit or credit card at the time you provide your debit or credit card information. After we verify that your debit or credit card information is accurate, usually within a few days, the authorization will be removed. You may be required to cancel your reservation in accordance with the Restaurant’s cancellation policy, which is disclosed at the time the reservation is made. OpenTable uses this debit or credit card information as described in our privacy policy and shall have no liability for any charges made to the debit or credit card account for any failure to cancel your reservation in accordance with a Restaurant’s cancellation policy.

        If you are unable to keep your reservation and you fail to cancel at least 30 minutes in advance of the reservation, Plated will send you an email letting you know that our records indicate that you were a no-show. Upon arriving at the Restaurant, it is the User’s responsibility to notify the host that the User has a reservation. By using the Reservation Services, User agrees to receive no-show notifications by email after a report that your reservation was not honored, whether or not that was in fact the case. Your Account will be suspended if you are a no-show for four reservations within a 12-month period. If you receive a no-show notification email in error, please click here for information on how to dispute it. User agrees that all final no-show determinations will be made by OpenTable in its sole discretion.

        If you wish to remove yourself from a waitlist you have joined through the Waitlist Services, you can do so by managing your place in line through the OpenTable Sites or by calling the Restaurant. Failure to appear at the Restaurant in a timely manner may result in the Restaurant bypassing your place on the waitlist for other guests or removing you from the waitlist entirely.

        3.  Plated Dining Rewards. Depending on your country of residency, you may be able to participate in Plated rewards program (Plated Dining Rewards”). Where applicable, participation is subject to the Plated Dining Rewards Terms and Conditions.

        4.  Usage Guidelines. User agrees to use the Reservation Services or Waitlist Services only to book reservations or join waitlists at Restaurants and then honor those reservations or waitlist requests by arriving at the Restaurants on time and ordering and paying for meals. User further agrees not to book more than one reservation or join more than one waitlist for User’s personal use during any one meal time (e.g., lunch, dinner, etc.). Administrative assistant and/or concierges may be able to book multiple reservations through OpenTable’s Administrative Assistant and/or Concierge programs, subject to any applicable program terms. Resale or attempted resale of reservations or waitlist spots is prohibited and is grounds for, among other things, cancellation of your reservations, removal from the waitlist or termination of your access to the Services.

        Part II – Payment, Gift Card and Other Services

        5. Payment, Gift Card and Other Services.
